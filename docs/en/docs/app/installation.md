# Installation

The application infrastructure is deployed from a Terraform-based GitHub template repository.

1. Open the [walkai-infra](https://github.com/walkai-org/walkai-infra) template repository.
2. Click **Use this template** to create your own repository based on it, and name it as you prefer.

You will use this repository in the next steps to configure GitHub Actions and run the deployment workflows.
